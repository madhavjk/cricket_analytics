        "\n",
        "<br>In this notebook, we will be analysing the impact of toss on the outcome of a match. and the steps we will be following are as follows-<br><br><br>\n",
        "<b> 1) Defining the context: </b>\n",
        "For any analysis, we will first need to develop an idea of the data that is required and also how are we going to breakdown the analysis into different categories. After finalising the structure of data to be used, the next task is to shortlist the parameters which we'll be using for performing the analysis.<br><br>\n",
        "<b> 2) Getting the data: </b>\n",
        "Now, the next task is to get the data in the required format discussed in previous step.<br><br>\n",
        "<b> 3) Pre-Processing the data: </b>\n",
        "After we get the data, the next step is to remove the extra information and clean the dataset to create a new one having the information which can be used for calculating parameters.<br><br>\n",
        "<b> 4) Calculating the parameters: </b>\n",
        "Now, we need to get the mathematical value of the parameters which we have shortlisted in the first step. So, in this step, we will use the preprocessed data to calculate the required parameters.<br><br>\n",
        "<b> 5) Conclusion: </b>\n",
        "Then using the calculated parameters, we try to find a trend from them and using this trend, we make a conclusion of our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's look at each of these 5 steps one by one for our analysis on impact of toss on outcome of a match.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Defining the context\n",
        "\n",
        "For sake of simplicity, we will only be considering the test matches, but the same analysis can be extrapolated to ODIs and T20Is as well. In this analysis, we will be loking at the impact of toss on the outcome of a match, so the data that we require should have the list of all the test matches that are played, their result, and the toss result. So, the necessary columns are team name, match result and toss result, for each test match happened. Also, for this analysis, we will be considering the recent generation's matches only, i.e. from 2016-present. This period is also selected because of the sudden increase in the of the use data from 2016. Now, since we are looking at test matches, there are 3 results possible for a match (win, lose, or draw), so the parameter that we should look for analysis should not be only focused on winning matches, but also on drawn test matches. So, for this analysis, we will consider lose percentage of a team, after they have one the toss and lost the toss. To summarize, <b>the data we will require is the scorecard data of each match, having result of the match and toss result, and the parameter we will be using for analysing the impact of toss will be the losing percentage of the team after they have won/lost the toss.</b>\n",
        "\n",
        "### Getting the data\n",
        "\n",
        "The data required for this analysis in the above mentioned format can be found on statsguru website (by ESPNCricinfo) by applying concerned filters. The procedure to go to the required page is:<br>\n",
        "1) Go to https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html and click on team tab. <br>\n",
        "2) Select \"Home Venue\" in Home or Away row and \"Match Results\" in View Format row. <br>\n",
        "3) Give the Starting date from 01 Jan 2016 and click Submit Query.<br>\n",
        "4) Go to page number 2 and copy the url. We have copied the url of page number 2 because when the first page is loaded, there is no mention of page number in the URL, but in the URL of page 2, there is a part as \"page=2\" which will be useful for us in automating the scraping for all pages in one go.<br><br>\n",
        "After we have the URL of the webpage, now we will create a web-scraper to scrape all the pages of the query that we gave. First we will create a scaper to scrape one page, and then we will repeat the same steps for all the pages to scrape all the pages."

        "We will not be considering Afghanistan and Ireland as the sample size is less for them. For India, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, losing percentage is at max 20% after winning the toss, which indicate that these teams uses the toss for their benefit and toss plays an important role in the outcome of the match. Also, for India it is only 5% which indicates that team India knows how to use the toss to their benefit very well. Teams like England, Bangladesh, West Indies and Pakistan are yet to figure out how to use the toss for their benefit as their losing percentages are high even after winning the toss. So, to conclude, it can be said that in test matches, toss plays an important role for top teams as they have less losing percentages whereas other teams are yet to take advantage of toss in tests."
